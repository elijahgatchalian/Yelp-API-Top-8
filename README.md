# YelpAPISearch
Remembering MySpace's Top 8, I thought of doing something similar to food places in your area!

I used Yelp's API to retrieve 20 restaurants in your city that are within $-$$$ range and sorted them by their ratings. I then 
converted the restaurant's data to JSON format.  Next, I created a window with the Top 8 of those places. The restaurant must 
have an image and Yelp url to make it to the Top  8. Once the 8 have been chosen, a window will appear with the restaurant's 
picture and a button that opens the restaurant's Yelp page.
