Using Yelp's API

Remembering MySpace's Top 8, I thought of doing something similar to food places in one's area!

I used Yelp's API to retrieve 20 restaurants in a user's city that are within $-$$$ range and sorted them by their ratings. 
Next, I created a window with the Top 8 of those places. The restaurant must have an image and yelp url to make it to the Top 
8. Once the 8 have been chosen, a window will appear with the restaurant's picture and a button that opens the restaurant's 
Yelp page.
